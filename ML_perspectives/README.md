## Hands-on: Training a sequence-based model

Notebook: [01_tutorial_training.ipynb](https://github.com/visze/foundations_in_medicine/blob/master/ML_perspectives/01_tutorial_training.ipynb)

### Data

The folder [resources/01_training](https://github.com/visze/foundations_in_medicine/blob/master/ML_perspectives/resources/01_training) contains the data used in this hands-on tutorial.

File name: `ultra_k562_full.tsv.gz`

Description: This file contains element headers, sequences, and 3 log2(RNA/DNA) values from a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) experiment [1] in K562 cells. 

The file is a tab-separated file with the following columns:

    - name: unique identifier for each element
    - sequence: DNA sequence of the element
    - log2.1: log2(RNA/DNA) value for the first replicate
    - log2.2: log2(RNA/DNA) value for the second replicate
    - log2.3: log2(RNA/DNA) value for the third replicate
    - log2.mean: mean of the three log2(RNA7DNA) values
